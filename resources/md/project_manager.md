Project Manager
===============

The project manager has the overall responsibility for the project.
He got a budget from somone outside the project (call it the "customer") and has the task to lead the project to success.

The success of a project is defined, by reaching the requirements (functional and time) in budget.

The budget is not necesary (only) money, but can be (and is often) a certain group of people (the team) and 
some resources (computers, offices etc.).

The responsibility of the project manager
-----------------------------------------

The responsibility of the project manager is to plan and control the budget and the requirements.
If there is, at any time, the risk of not fulfilling the requirements (functionally and time) within the given
budget, he has to inform the "customer".

This includes, that he __must not__ even start a project, if it is clear in advance,
that it's not possible within the given budget
(both, money  and resources).

Technical responsibility
------------------------

The project manager is not considered to be the most scilled person in the project.
He will trust the decitions of the specialists in the project team.
If the skills of the team are insufficiant, it's the responsibility of the project manager to
find a solution within the possibilities of the budget.
