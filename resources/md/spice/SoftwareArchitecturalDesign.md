04-04 Software architectural design
===================================

- Describes the overall software structure
- Describes the operative system including task structure
- Identifies inter-task/inter-process communication
- Identifies the required software elements
- Identifies own developed and supplied code
- Identifies the relationship and dependency between software elements
- Identifies where the data (such as parameters) are stored and which measures (e.g. checksums, redundancy) are taken to prevent data corruption
- Describes how variants for different model series or configurations are derived
- Describes the dynamic behavior of the software (Start-up, shutdown, software update, error handling and recovery, etc.)
- Identifies where the data (such as parameters) are stored and which measures (e.g. checksums, redundancy) are taken to prevent data corruption
- Describes which data is persistent and under which conditions
- Consideration is given to:
    - any required software performance characteristics
    - any required software interfaces
    - any required security characteristics required
    - any database design requirements
