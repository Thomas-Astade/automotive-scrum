13-22 Traceability record
=========================

* All requirements (customer and internal) are to be traced
* Identifies a mapping of requirement to life cycle work products
* Provides the linkage of requirements to work product decomposition (i.e., requirement  design  code  test  deliverables, etc.)
* Provides forward and backwards mapping of requirements to associated work products throughout all phases of the life cycle

*NOTE: this may be included as a function of another defined work 
product (example: A CASE tool for design decomposition may have a 
mapping ability as part of its features)*
