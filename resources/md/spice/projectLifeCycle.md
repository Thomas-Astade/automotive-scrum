----------

Define project life cycle. Define the life cycle for the project,
which is appropriate to the scope, context, magnitude and complexity of the
project. 

The outcome of this practice is: the feasibility of achieving the goals of the project with available
resources and constraints is evaluated;

*NOTE 1: This typically means that the project life cycle and the customer's
development process are consistent with each other.*
