Planning
========

Resources are limited. So not everything which is decided to do at all, can be done at once.

Planning is the activity which priories the issues and assigns the ones which are to be fixed, __now__.

There should be a limited number of issues in state "Assigned" (1-2 weeks of work, at maximum).
If there is just a huge bunch of issues is already in "Assigned" planning will lose the control
which means, there is not really any "planning" any more.
