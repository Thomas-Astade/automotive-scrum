Report issue solved
===================

If an issue gets solved, there must be a dedicated moment, where the state changes from "Assigned" to "Solved".

As long as it is not in the "Resolved" state, there might be things which are still missing.
When the state changes, there _must not_ miss anything which is needed for the issue.

A short (and maybe incomplete) checklist:
* Source code is checked in, into the repository.
* There is something add to the release notes.
* A new unit test is created and add to the overall unit tests.
* In case of a feature, the end-user documentation is updated.
* The technical documentation is updated.
