Effort review
=============

The effort review is considered for the business decision, if an issue should be solved.
For bugs this is often the case, but even for them it might be just not effective to fix (from
the business point of view).

For features its even more important, because every new feature costs money and changes the 
spirit of a product.
In this review the decision has to be taken, if the issue should be done, or better not.
