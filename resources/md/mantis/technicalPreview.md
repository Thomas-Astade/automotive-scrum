Technical preview
=================

The technical preview is considered to ensure, that all technical aspects of an issue are touched in the issue description.

Please check if:
* all requirements are described and can be understood.
* necessary traces and screen-shots are attached.
* the request can be fulfilled technically (performance, data structure, hardware limitations, ...)

Maybe at this point there are already some design ideas. So don't hesitate to write them down.

If the issue can not be understood, it shall be transfered to "Feedback" to gather the missing information.

It could even be, that the preview cannot be completed, because a prove of concept must be done beforehand.
In this case a separate issue shall be created, to do the prove of concept.

When the preview is done, the issue should contain:

* a rough idea, how the issue should be handled (unless it's obvious)
* an effort estimation (also this might be difficult, especially for bugs).
