Some guidelines for entering issues
-----------------------------------

If you enter an issue you want help. Mostly you want it fast. So it seems that there is no time to enter all the information fields which are requested.

Often this ends up, that feedback is needed. So if you enter an issue, take you time. Enter all information you have, especially release information, because this is not obvious. Use exact release numbers not phrases like "new release" or "latest software".

Please describe, what you expected to happen! This is obvious for __you__ but not for the reader of the issue. In addition, explain how someone else (who might not have your environment) can reproduce the behavior. Yes, that's maybe not easy!

And last but not least, describe the wrong behaviour you saw. Attach traces, dumps, screenshots, test data ... whatever might be useful to understand what was going wrong.
