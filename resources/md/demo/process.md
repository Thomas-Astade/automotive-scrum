Demo Process
============

The demo process is just for tool demonstration purposes.
It models some aspect of a normal software development process,
but it is not considered to be complete or useful in any case.
Its only purpose is, to demonstrate this website and how processes are displayed.

It is a demonstration of the process meta model used on this site. Nothing more than that.
