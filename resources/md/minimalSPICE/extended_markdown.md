Extended Markdown
=================

Extended Markdown is a special format (actually a DSL), used in this process for tracability.
While the file is 100% markdown compliant, there are some additional tags to identify relations (links).

Because this links can be easily identified by text searches, a small helper (script) is able to collect all links and add 
the corresponding backward links.
This ensures, that forward and backward links are always consistent (not more than that).

- All reqirement documents are written in "Extended Markdown".

- The "Extended Markdown" files are considered to be "sourcefiles" of the requirement document (and are configuration items).
